{"meta":{"id":"62E065F712211563","name":"Custom Colored Roles by flabby","description":"**Arma Reforger - Staff Chat Roles** is a project designed to enhance server communication by adding role-based prefixes to player chat messages. Assigned roles, such as abbreviations (\"ADM\") or full titles (\"Moderator\"), are displayed alongside player names in chat, making staff easily identifiable. These roles are stored in a persistent configuration file, ensuring data is retained across server restarts and allowing admins to manage roles efficiently. The system seamlessly integrates with chat, automatically applying prefixes when players send messages, improving organization, transparency, and server management.\n\nSupport: https://flabby.dev/discord\n\nCommands require you to log-in as admin.
